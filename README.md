## Project Status
Currently in alpha stage, ComidaAI is a personal project born from the intersection of software engineering and fitness interests. It serves as both a practical tool for daily use and a technical exploration of modern web technologies.

## Problem Space
Traditional calorie tracking apps often require cumbersome manual input and navigation. ComidaAI addresses this by allowing users to simply photograph their meals, automatically identifying ingredients while maintaining the flexibility for user adjustments. This approach makes food tracking more accessible and sustainable for daily use.
